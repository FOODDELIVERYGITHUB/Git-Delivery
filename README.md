# Git-Delivery

This GitHub page is how we will develop our work together! We can see what changes have been made to code. Be careful when pushing/merging things to the main branch as that will be our main work :^)


## How to view/run the website
I would advise using VSC and Live Server to see what the website looks like! As we move to PHP, it would be ideal to utilise the MI-Linux server so you can see the PHP in action.

## Support

Any questions you have about the code, feel free to ask in the Discord channel created!
