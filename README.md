# Git-Delivery

This GitHub page is how we will develop our work together! We can see what changes have been made to code as well as submit our own.

## SUPER IMPORTANT READ THIS ##
ALL THE WORK YOU DO SHOULD BE DONE IN YOUR OWN BRANCH! THIS SHOULD THEN BE PULL REQUESTED TO THE MAIN WHERE SAMUEL CAN APPROVE OR DENY CODE BEING PUT INTO THE MAIN. IF WE ALL SEND TO MAIN IT CAN BREAK ALL OF THE WORK. THIS IS WHY GITHUB WILL ALWAYS SUGGEST PULLING FROM MAIN BEFORE YOU START WORKING ON YOUR OWN BRANCH (IT MAKES SURE YOU HAVE THE MOST UP TO DATE WORK)

## How to view/run the website
I would advise using VSC and Live Server to see what the website looks like! As we move to PHP, it would be ideal to utilise the MI-Linux server so you can see the PHP in action.

## Support

Any questions you have about the code, feel free to ask in the Discord channel created!
